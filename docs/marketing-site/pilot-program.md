# EcoPulse Pilot Program

**Program:** EcoPulse 12-Month Program (with an initial 90-Day Pilot Phase)  
**Region (MVP):** Nigeria (final pilot communities selected with implementing partners)  
**Version:** v1.0 (Draft for PDF conversion)  
**Date:** 2025-12-26  
**Contact:** info@ecopulse.app

## Executive Summary

Environmental hazards like unmanaged waste and blocked drainage often persist because the evidence is fragmented, hard to verify, and difficult to coordinate into action. EcoPulse is a community-driven platform that turns on-the-ground reports into **structured, verified, privacy-respecting evidence** that partners can trust—so response can be prioritized, tracked, and improved.

This program is structured as a **12-month partnership program**, beginning with a focused **90-day pilot phase**. The goal of the pilot phase is not perfection—it’s proof: proof that communities will report consistently, that verification can be reliable, and that partners can coordinate response workflows with measurable outcomes.

## Why This Program, Why Now

- **Climate volatility + urban growth** are turning “routine” drainage and waste issues into cascading flood and public health risks.
- **Communities already see the issues first**, but lack a trusted channel that turns local truth into coordinated response.
- **Partners need evidence they can defend**: verified, time-stamped, location-based records with before/after documentation.

EcoPulse is built for the realities of many African communities: mobile-first, low-bandwidth tolerant, and designed for trust.

---

## Who This Program Is For

### Primary partners

- Community-based organizations (CBOs)
- Local NGOs (environment, health, WASH, resilience)
- Resident associations / community champions

### Secondary partners

- Municipal sanitation and drainage units
- Private waste operators / contractors
- Local media and advocacy organizations

### Minimum partner readiness (lightweight)

- A named focal person (1)
- Community champions / volunteers for onboarding and verification (recommended 5–15 depending on pilot size)
- A defined response pathway (municipal, contractor, NGO operations, or community action)
- Weekly coordination touchpoint (30–60 minutes)

---

## Program Structure

### The 12-month program (overview)

The full program builds partner capacity and community adoption while producing reliable evidence and operational playbooks that can scale.

### The first 90 days (pilot phase)

The pilot phase is the “proof window” to validate:

1. **Adoption**: communities can report issues consistently.
2. **Integrity**: community verification produces trusted data.
3. **Coordination**: partners can triage, respond, and close the loop with measurable SLAs.

---

## Theory of Change (Plain Language)

If communities can report hazards easily and safely, and if those reports are verified by independent local verifiers, then partners can prioritize and coordinate response more effectively.

**Inputs → Activities → Outputs → Outcomes**

- Inputs: community champions, partner response pathways, EcoPulse platform, minimal resources (training/data/device support).
- Activities: reporting, verification, triage, response coordination, closure documentation.
- Outputs: verified reports, hotspot insights, response logs, partner dashboards/exports.
- Outcomes: faster response, fewer repeat hotspots, improved accountability and trust.

---

## How EcoPulse Works (Workflow)

### 1) Report (community)

A resident submits:

- At least one photo
- Location
- Category (Phase 1: waste or drainage)
- A clear written note (quality guidance provided during onboarding)

### 2) Verify (community)

Nearby community members verify what they see.

- **Verification threshold:** 2 independent verifications
- **Anti-self-verification:** the system blocks verifying your own report
- **Duplicate protections:** limits repeated verification from the same verifier

### 3) Coordinate response (partners)

Partners see verified issues and run a simple workflow:

- Triage (what’s urgent, what’s feasible)
- Assign (who responds)
- Track (status updates)
- Close the loop (before/after evidence when possible)

### 4) Learn and improve (monthly)

We review:

- What is working
- What is noisy
- Where response stalls
- How to improve onboarding, verification quality, and coordination

---

## Scope (Pilot Phase)

### Target geography

- Nigeria, with pilot communities finalized with implementing partners (urban + peri-urban candidates)

### Issue categories (Phase 1)

- **Waste & litter**: illegal dumping, refuse accumulation, market waste
- **Drainage & flood risk**: blocked drains, water pooling, flood-prone points

### Phase 2 (post-pilot expansion)

- Urban heat
- Water quality
- Air/smoke

## 90-Day Pilot Phase Plan (Week-by-Week)

### Weeks 1–2: Onboard & Launch

- Partner alignment: scope, boundaries, categories, escalation path
- Training: champions, verifiers, response focal points
- Community activation: simple comms rollout
- First reporting + verification cycles

**Deliverables:**

- Pilot scope brief (communities + roles + escalation contacts)
- Onboarding toolkit (scripts, posters, WhatsApp text)
- Baseline notes (what issues are most common today)

### Weeks 3–6: Operate & Stabilize

- Weekly triage clinic (partner + community champions)
- Verification quality review (spot-checks)
- Response logging standards adopted (what “attempted response” means)

**Deliverables:**

- Weekly snapshot reports
- Early hotspot map + issue inventory

### Weeks 7–10: Optimize & Strengthen Response

- Improve community onboarding based on early friction
- Refine triage rules (urgency, severity, feasibility)
- Build partner playbooks (response handoff, escalation ladder)

**Deliverables:**

- Updated operating playbook
- Response pathway diagram + SLA targets

### Weeks 11–13: Evaluate & Publish

- Analyze outcomes, bottlenecks, and adoption
- Produce a pilot summary and recommendations
- Decide scale plan for months 4–12

**Deliverables:**

- Pilot Evaluation Summary (what worked / didn’t / next)
- Scale blueprint (communities to add, resources needed)

---

## Months 4–12: Scale & Sustainability

### Scale strategy

- Expand to additional communities only after:
  - Verification quality is stable
  - Response pathways are clear
  - Weekly ops cadence is functioning

### Sustainability options (partner-led)

- District/community sponsorship packages
- Partner subscriptions for advanced exports (never data monetization)
- Grant funding / fiscal sponsorship pathways

## Data Governance, Privacy, and Trust Commitments

EcoPulse is designed to minimize personal data and reduce harm risks.

### What we collect

- Photo evidence
- Approximate location (to enable mapping and verification)
- Issue category and written description
- Optional account info (if the reporter chooses to register)

### Anonymous reporting

- Supported via a local session identifier stored in the browser (not device fingerprinting)
- Session-based access is time-limited (implementation uses a 7-day expiry window)

### Photo privacy

- Photos are processed to remove EXIF metadata prior to upload
- Guidance is provided to avoid capturing faces, IDs, and sensitive personal details

### What we do NOT optimize for

- Surveillance or data monetization
- Collecting unnecessary personal identifiers
- “Vanity metrics” at the expense of trust and safety

---

## Safeguarding & Community Safety

- Clear safe-reporting guidance (what not to photograph)
- Anti-harassment and anti-misuse policies
- Escalation pathways for sensitive reports

---

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk                       | Early warning signals             | Mitigation                                                  |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Low adoption               | Few reports week-to-week          | Champion-led onboarding; clear comms; simplify steps        |
| Low verification integrity | High dispute rate; low verified % | Training; spot-check audits; tighten verification guidance  |
| Partner non-response       | Verified issues stuck             | Escalation ladder; weekly triage; define SLAs upfront       |
| Safety concerns            | Fear of reporting                 | Anonymous flows; safe-reporting guidance; privacy-by-design |
| Misinformation / spam      | Repeated misleading reports       | Verification threshold; deduplication; moderation           |

---

## Budget Framework (Ranges)

Actual figures depend on pilot size and partner setup.

Typical cost categories:

- Community onboarding (training, materials)
- Champion stipends / coordination support
- Device/data support (where needed)
- Response micro-grants (for rapid action)
- Monitoring, evaluation, and learning (MEL)

---

## Short description

EcoPulse is a community reporting + verification platform helping communities reduce drainage/waste/flooding impacts and protect water quality through transparent, evidence-based reporting and coordinated response.

Planning an initial $50–100k philanthropic request (AJA Foundation Water pillar LOI). Seeking fiscal sponsorship so we can apply under a 501(c)(3) umbrella and administer funds compliantly.

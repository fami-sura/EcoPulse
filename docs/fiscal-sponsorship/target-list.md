# Target List (Start Here)

This list is optimized for EcoPulse’s situation: **no legal entity yet**, international pilot (Nigeria/Niger/Chad), target **$50–100k**, and the need to satisfy funders that expect a 501(c)(3).

## Tier 1 (best immediate fit)

1. **Global Impact (charity.org)** — Fiscal Sponsorship

- Why: explicitly supports groups without nonprofit status; global scope; clear application form.
- Apply: https://charity.org/fiscal-sponsorship-application/
- Overview: https://charity.org/fiscal-sponsorship/

2. **Panorama Global** — Fiscal Sponsorship (Model A is designed for launching)

- Why: explicitly supports global projects; Model A is for launching new ideas; clear fee range (Model A typically 10–12%).
- Intake: https://panoramagroup.tfaforms.net/22
- Overview: https://panoramaglobal.org/fiscal-sponsorship

## Tier 2 (possibly fit; requires discovery call)

3. **Empowers Africa** — Fiscal sponsor program

- Why: 501(c)(3) that accepts donations and grants for partners; likely oriented to Africa-based partners.
- Page: https://empowersafrica.org/donate/
- Contact: info@empowersafrica.org (from their page)

4. **New Venture Fund (NVF)** — fiscal sponsorship/incubation platform

- Why: large, experienced fiscal sponsor; can be selective; may fit if the project aligns with their focus areas.
- Info: https://newventurefund.org/how-we-work/

## Tier 3 (not a fit right now, but useful later)

5. **Give to Africa** — Fiscal Sponsorship

- Not fit now: requires registered org in Africa + 8+ years experience + staff + $50k operating budget.
- Page: https://2africa.org/fiscal-sponsorship/

6. **Social Good Fund**

- Not fit now: their international model indicates it needs a US-based co-signer and a legally registered NGO in-country.

## How to use this list

- Start with Tier 1: submit applications and request calls.
- Use Tier 2 to expand your funnel (in case Tier 1 timelines don’t match).
- Keep Tier 3 as future pathways once EcoPulse has a registered entity or a US co-signer.

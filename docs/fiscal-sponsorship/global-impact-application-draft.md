EcoPulse helps communities in Nigeria, Niger, and Chad protect water quality and reduce flooding/drainage impacts by enabling residents to report issues with evidence, verify them quickly, and coordinate response transparently.

## 7) Brief Description of Project Activities

We operate a mobile-first platform where residents submit waste/drainage/flooding issues with photos + geolocation. Community verification increases accuracy and accountability. Verified issues are routed to responders/partners, and resolution status is tracked with transparent reporting. We also deliver lightweight community education prompts to reduce recurrence and support sustainability.

We are planning a 12-month program with an initial 90-day pilot phase focused on validating adoption, verification quality, and response coordination.

# Outreach Templates (Fiscal Sponsorship)

## 1) Email — Short (initial)

**Subject:** Fiscal sponsorship request (Water resilience pilot: Nigeria/Niger/Chad, $50–100k)

Hello {Name/Team},

I’m building EcoPulse (E‑Community Pulse), a community reporting + verification platform to reduce flooding/drainage impacts and protect water quality by improving detection, verification, and coordinated response.

We’re preparing a $50–100k LOI to the AJA Foundation (Water pillar) and are seeking a fiscal sponsor that can receive philanthropic funds and support compliant disbursement to vendors/contractors for a 12‑month pilot across Nigeria, Niger, and Chad.

Could we schedule a 20‑minute call to confirm fit, fee structure, onboarding timeline, and requirements? I can share a 1‑page overview and draft budget.

Thanks,

## 2) Email — Slightly longer (adds credibility)

**Subject:** EcoPulse — fiscal sponsorship inquiry (AJA Water LOI, Nigeria/Niger/Chad)

Hello {Name/Team},

EcoPulse (E‑Community Pulse) is building a mobile-first reporting + verification workflow so communities can flag waste/drainage issues with photos + location, verify quickly, and coordinate response. The goal is sustainable water-impact: fewer blocked drains, less contamination risk, and improved accountability in response.

We’re seeking fiscal sponsorship for a 12‑month pilot (Nigeria, Niger, Chad) and a $50–100k philanthropic request (initially AJA Foundation / Water pillar). We need a sponsor able to receive funds under a 501(c)(3) umbrella and support compliant disbursement and basic reporting.

If this could be a fit, can we schedule a short call? I’ll share our 1‑page sponsor pack + draft budget.

Thank you,
{Your Name}

## 3) LinkedIn DM (super short)

## 4) Follow-up (Day 4–5)

**Subject:** Re: Fiscal sponsorship request (EcoPulse / AJA Water LOI)

Hello {Name/Team},

Quick follow-up in case this got buried. We’re trying to lock a fiscal sponsor this month to submit a $50–100k AJA Foundation Water LOI (Nigeria/Niger/Chad). Happy to send our 1‑page overview + budget, or jump on a 20‑minute call.

Thanks,

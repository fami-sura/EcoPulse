# Fiscal Sponsorship Sprint (10 Days)

Goal: secure a fiscal sponsor able to receive and administer a **$50–100k** grant for EcoPulse’s **Water**-aligned program (Nigeria / Niger / Chad) with an initial **90-day pilot phase**, enabling an AJA Foundation LOI that can truthfully use a sponsor’s 501(c)(3) + EIN.

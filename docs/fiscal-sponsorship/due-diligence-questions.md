# Fiscal Sponsor Due Diligence (Compare Sponsors)

## Must-haves for EcoPulse

- Can accept philanthropic grants/donations for international work (Nigeria/Niger/Chad)
- Has a 501(c)(3) entity usable for LOIs where required
- Can disburse funds to vendors/contractors (or reimburse) compliantly
- Can onboard an early-stage project (no existing legal entity)

## Questions to ask (copy/paste)

### Fees

- % of funds managed? Any sliding scale?
- Startup fee? Ongoing admin fee? Monthly minimum?

### Timeline

- Time from intake → approval → project account live?
- Do you require committed funding before onboarding?

### Controls / approvals

- What expenses require pre-approval?
- How fast are vendor payments processed?
- Can we hire contractors (US + international)?

### International compliance

- Any country restrictions or enhanced due diligence for Nigeria/Niger/Chad?
- Requirements for vendor onboarding (KYC/AML)?

### Fundraising + branding

- Can we publicly say “EcoPulse is fiscally sponsored by {Sponsor}”?
- Can we apply to funders listing sponsor EIN + address?
- Who signs grant agreements (sponsor vs project lead)?

### Data / privacy

- Do you have requirements around data collection in-country?

### Exit plan

- How does spin-out work once EcoPulse forms an entity?

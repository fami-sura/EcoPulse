# EcoPulse (E-Community Pulse) — Fiscal Sponsorship Request

## One-liner

EcoPulse is a community reporting + verification platform helping cities and communities reduce flood/drainage impacts and protect water quality by turning local observations into verified, actionable response.

## The problem (Water-first)

In Nigeria, Niger, and Chad, blocked drains, unmanaged waste, and flooding contaminate water sources and increase disease risk. Communities often lack a trusted, low-friction way to report issues, verify them quickly, and coordinate response.

## Our solution

EcoPulse enables:

- **Report:** residents submit waste/drainage issues with photo + geolocation
- **Verify:** community verification reduces false reports and prioritizes what matters
- **Coordinate:** responders/NGOs see validated issues and track resolution
- **Learn:** lightweight community education prompts improve safe practices and long-term prevention

## Proposed pilot (12 months)

- **Countries:** Nigeria, Niger, Chad
- **Focus:** drainage/waste hotspots impacting water quality and flood risk
- **Outputs (draft targets):**
  - 1,500+ community reports submitted
  - 700+ verified issues (threshold-based verification)
  - 200+ issues resolved/closed with evidence
  - monthly public transparency summaries (counts + categories + response time)

## Funding need

Seeking **$50–100k** in philanthropic funding (initial target: AJA Foundation, Water pillar). Funds will support local operations, verification workflows, vendor/contractor services, and pilot delivery.

## What we need from a fiscal sponsor

We are seeking a fiscal sponsor that can:

- receive philanthropic grant funds under its 501(c)(3) umbrella
- hold and administer funds with basic compliance + reporting
- pay approved vendors/contractors (and/or reimburse against invoices)
- support compliant international operations across Nigeria/Niger/Chad

## Why EcoPulse is a good sponsorship candidate

- Water-aligned mission with measurable outcomes and sustainability emphasis
- Verification model creates accountability and reduces wasted response effort
- Built for mobile-first access; designed for low-resource contexts
- Clear pilot scope, deliverables, and learning agenda

## Status (transparent)

- Product is in active development; a minimal public website/landing page will be available within ~2 weeks.
- Pilot partners are being identified in parallel with fiscal sponsorship.
